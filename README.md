# sushiGame
Capstone project in foundations of programming course that implemented practically every component of computer science learned in the course and its prerequisite. Awarded extra credit separate from the rubric for creating a product that went above and beyond the requirements of the assignment.

This final assignment included taking a bare interface and designing it to serve as the forefront of a game that revolved around preparation and sale of sushi in a competition versus the computer. This was executed using JSwing along with various other native Java features.

Utilizing the model-view-controller architecture, observers and observables, interfaces, inheritance, and classes, this project was a culmination of all computer science concepts that had been taught up to that time.

Game instructions:
The game simulates a rotating sushi conveyor belt and intends for the player to create sushi on plates of certain colors that signify different tiers of price. The computer chefs will do the same and computer customers will chose the sushi they prefer the most, with different customers having different preferences. Sushi may become old if it sits on the belt too long without a customer eating it.
